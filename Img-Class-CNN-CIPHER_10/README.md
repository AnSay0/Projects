In this project, I built and trained Convolutional neural network Model on CIFAR-10 dataset . CIFAR-10 is a standard dataset , It consists of 60,000 (32Ã—32) color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data. The training dataset was splitted into 45,000 images for training and 5,000 images for validation. Accuracy of 87.66% were achieved after testing the model on testing data set.
